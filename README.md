# Sentiment-Analysis-Twitter-NLP
Sentiment Classification of Tweets Using NLP
Team Project by: James Wachira, Tim Musungu, Vivian Kwamboka, Calvin Mutua, Hashim Ibrahim

🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to classify tweets about products into Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

Businesses can use these insights to:

Understand customer opinions and brand perception.

Improve products and services based on feedback.

Monitor reputation in real-time on social media.

📊 Data
Source: Tweets dataset (tweets.csv) containing:

Raw tweet text

Labeled sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

🔧 Methodology
Text Preprocessing
Tokenization with TweetTokenizer

Conversion to lowercase

Removal of special characters

Stopword removal

Lemmatization with WordNetLemmatizer

Feature Engineering
Vectorization:

CountVectorizer (word counts)

TF-IDF Vectorizer (term importance across corpus)

Optional dimensionality reduction with PCA

Modeling
Models Used:

Multinomial Naïve Bayes

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Additional Techniques:

SMOTE for handling imbalanced sentiment classes

Pipelines for clean preprocessing & modeling

GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

✅ Results & Insights
Best performing models:

Random Forest

Naïve Bayes

SMOTE significantly improved results for minority classes.

Preprocessing boosted model performance considerably.

Random Forest provided good balance of accuracy and interpretability.

💡 Business Recommendations
Amplify messaging around topics with positive sentiment.

Proactively engage with negative sentiment tweets to protect brand reputation.

Deploy the model as part of a real-time sentiment monitoring dashboard for continuous insights.
